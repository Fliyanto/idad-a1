          <h2>Introduction To Analysis:</h2>
        </header>
        <p>
          The way people interact with digital environments is greatly
          influenced by user interface (UI) design.
          <a href="https://orb.farm/" target="blank"> Orb Farm </a>
          and
          <a href="https://holdspace.surge.sh/" target="_blank"> Hold Space</a>
          , two distinctly different examples, present opposing approaches when
          it comes to user interaction and experience. Users can explore
          changing sounds and visual patterns by pressing and holding the
          spacebar in a minimalistic and audio-visual web experience presented
          by Hold Space. On the other hand, Orb Farm is a virtual build-your-own
          pixel-art ecosystem experience where users can develop their ecosystem
          and watch it grow, from piling sand, creating an algae farm, adding
          life forms and more. Although both Orb Farm and Hold Space use
          interactions as their main source of attraction, their approaches in
          developing such interactions are quite different.

        <h2>Compare And Contrast:</h2>
      </header>
      <h3>Information Design</h3>
      <p>
        Hold Space utilises a simplistic and minimalist approach to information
        design. Opening with a simple one-line instruction to guide the user
        through each step, enveloped in a simplistic white and black colour
        scheme. With this in mind, the user can concentrate on the captivating
        audio-visual transformation happening as they interact without being
        disturbed by other features, truly promoting the focus on the audio
        emitted throughout. Orb Farm, on the other hand, uses a retro Windows 98
        style, pixelated screens with bright colour contrast, giving it a
        nostalgic feeling. Orb Farm opens with a short pop-up instruction that
        cannot be missed, ensuring the users understand how it operates before
        diving freely into building their sandbox ecosystem. Different from Hold
        Space, Orb Farm utilises a toolbar on the side, placing all the
        interactive buttons labelled, helping promote users' inquiry to
        experimentation.
      </p>
      <h3>Mapping</h3>
      <p>
        In terms of mapping, there is a significant difference between the two.
        Orb Farm uses a variety of interactions placed on the side of the
        screen, taking the form of a toolbar. This toolbar holds many different
        buttons corresponding with the elements users can use to create their
        ecosystem, such as â€˜Sandâ€™, â€˜Fishâ€™, â€˜Algaeâ€™ and more. In contrast to the
        toolbar, Hold Space relies on a single click and press of the spacebar
        for its user to interact with their elements. With this interaction,
        sound and visual changes and intensify with the duration of the hold.
      </p>
      <h3>Characterisation</h3>
      <p>
        Both Orb Farm and Hold Space create a vivid experience for their users
        in distinctive ways. The simplistic theme creates a highlight in Hold
        Space, focusing the users towards the soundscape and the geometric shape
        that changes depending on the user's input. With the focus being the
        sound and movement, it creates a living experience for its users.
        Alternatively, Orb Farm provides a unique approach of characters,
        including fish, bacteria and algae that respond to the userâ€™s ecosystem
        design by living, growing and dying. In comparison to Hold Spaceâ€™s
        abstract performance, the entire orb transforms into a self-developing
        world of its own, creating many possible outcomes for the users to
        explore.
      </p>
      <h3>Feedback</h3>
      <p>
        Lastly, there is a clear distinction in how both use feedback. Hold
        Space offers a sudden and instantaneous sensory feedback, visual changes
        reinforced by progressive sound that gets louder and more intense the
        longer the input is pressed. Followed by an instantaneous de-escalation
        of sound and visual changes as the input is released. In contrast,
        despite being a visually silent interaction, Orb Farm provides visual
        feedback from depth perspective changes when pressing a button,
        constantly changing background to simulate time passed and a CO2/O2
        meter that helps indicate the success rate of the ecosystem built by the
        users, presenting a clear understanding of life in the ecosystem.
